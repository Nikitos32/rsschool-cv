    <h3>About Myself:</h3>
    <p>I started programming at the age of 17 when he entered the IT University of BSUIR in Minsk.
        At first, programming seemed very difficult and I began to think that it was not mine, but
        then I joined the learning process and everything began to work out. in the 2nd year, I really
        enjoyed doing layout and frontend programming in general. For myself, I was engaged in photography
        and editing these photos in programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. Also in the 3rd year
        I liked Java and in the future I think that I will master it too. In my free time I play guitar, drums. </p>
