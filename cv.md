### About Myself:
He started programming at the age of 17 when he entered the IT University of BSUIR in Minsk.  
At first, programming seemed very difficult and I began to think that it was not mine, but  
then I joined the learning process and everything began to work out. in the 2nd year, I really  
enjoyed doing layout and frontend programming in general. For myself, I was engaged in photography  
and editing these photos in programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. Also in the 3rd year  
I liked Java and in the future I think that I will master it too. In my free time I play guitar, drums.
